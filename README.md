# boss-fight

going to use similar model as other flap-bird game, Super Meat Boy

# Ideas
Bosses over and over again, the bosses will scale in hp and damage, but you will scale in shooting speed and hp.

# Why?

Inspired by a plethora of games, I am going to code a boss fight, where its quick and casual but can go on for a long time. 
Something to do in class, that is unblocked.
